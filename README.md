### TechDegree Project 2  
Disclaimer: I completed this project as part of my Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. CSS and HTML were provided.

## About
This project enhances a web page using pagination and filtering.  Starting with a list of 54 students with photos and emails, the application displays 10 students at a time and adds a navigation system, a series of links at the bottom of page, to allow users to click through students, 10 at a time.  Users can also filter students by name, using the search bar.  

### Technologies
