# Techdegree-Project-2
I enchanced the usability of this webpage, which orignally displayed only one long list of student information, using JavaScript.  The code takes the student list contained in the html and displays upto 10 students per page while creating corresponding page links below.  Users can then click then links to display different pages.  

I'm going for exceeds expectations on this project.  As a result, I dynamically created and appended a search bar. 
When the "Search" button is clicked, the list is filtered by student name for those that include the search value. 
To improve the functionality and add to the user experience, I added a keyup event listener to the search input so that the list filters in real time as the user types.  Additionally, pagination links are displayed based on how many search results are returned.
